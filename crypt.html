            <h3>The Showdown</h3>
            <p>
               A voice rings out from the dark. "What did you do that for?"<br>
               "I have no time for riddles!" You shout.<br> 
               "You could've just pulled the door open."<br>
               "Oh. Well it doesn't matter anymore! Where is my precious item that you stole?"<br>
               The person the voice belonged to emerged from the shadows. You gasp.<br>
               From that darkness, a person who looks <em>exactly</em> like you steps forward.<br><br>
               You begin to feel weightless. You look down, but you only see the floor below you. 
               As the realization of the trap you blindly walked into sets in, whoever stole your body begins to laugh.
