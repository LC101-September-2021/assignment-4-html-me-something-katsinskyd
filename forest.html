            <h3>In the Woods</h3>
            <p>
               It was the middle of the day when you set out from your home, but in the middle of the forest it's as dark as night.
               The canopy is so dense with leaves, barely any light shines through. "Man," you sigh, "I wish I brought a flashlight." 
               Suddenly, you hear a growl from somewhere behind you. "Oh crud!" You don't even bother to turn around and look at whatever creature made the noise.
               You just book it.

            <h3>The Clearing</h3>
            <p>
               After a while, you see a light beyond the trees! You leap from the woods and you can hear that whatever was chasing you has stopped.
               <em>Huff... huff...</em> 
               It's a clearing. The sun shines brightly above you, indicating it's just a bit after midday. Seems like a good spot to take a break!
               You find a few mushrooms at the edge of the clearing and get an idea for a new recipe...

            <h3>A Nice Meal</h3>

            <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
            <ul>
               <li>Potatoes</li>

            </ul>

            </ul>

            <p>You feel a little foolish trying to cut these vegetables with your axe, but it's all you have right now.
               After following your made up instructions, you realize you don't have any utensils to eat your meal with.
               You wait for things to cool down a bit before you start using your hands to shovel the food in your mouth.<br><br>
