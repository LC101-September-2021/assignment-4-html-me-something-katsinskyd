            <h3>Where It Begins</h3>
            <p>
               Your lovely cottage on the edge of the forest is a mess. 
               Chairs thrown about, jars broken, objects on the ground when they should be on the table and objects on the table that should be on the ground.  
               <b>Who did this?</b> You had just arrived home from a relaxing day collecting berries and singing to the birds, how could this be?
               A note, stabbed into the doorframe by an elaborate knife, catches your eye:<br/>
               <h4><em>What you hold most precious to you is now mine. If you want it back, you'll have to fight me for it. 
                  You have three days. I will meet you in the crypts beneath the castle beyond the woods.</em></h4><br/>
                  "What the heck!" you shout. Obviously, you would accept this challenge.
