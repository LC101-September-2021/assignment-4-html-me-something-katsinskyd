            <h3>At the Gate</h3>
            <p>
               You spend the rest of the day and most of the next one travelling through the forest before you arrive at the gate.
               This castle has been abandoned for quite some time. You've known it as just a monument and have never cared to step foot in it before.
               Who knows what may lie ahead? You muster your courage and head through.

            <h3>The Entrance to the Crypt</h3>
            <p>
               After wandering around the quiet, empty, and terribly dusty halls, you finally come across the entrance to the crypt, hidden just around the corner from the gate you had passed through hours before.
               Letting out a frustrated sigh, you descend the spiral stairway and arrive at a large wooden door. You attempt to push it, but it doesn't budge. You look up.
               Above it is inscribed a long message:</p>
               <h4 style="text-align:center; color:brown; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I shall open only for those who are blah blah blah</h4> 
               <p>"Blah blah yadda yadda whatever, you'll open for this!" You raise your axe and hack away at the door.</p>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">With this obstacle removed from your path, you step into &rarr; <a href="crypt.html"><b>the crypt...</b></a></p>
